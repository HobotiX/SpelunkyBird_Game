Description:
	I followed a flappy bird clone tutorial to make the framework for this application and modified the width of the "pipes" , as well as adding a floating obstacle to mimic the Helicopter Game (http://www.play-helicopter-game.com/). I also added a few features like a background image, and a high score. I started to implement a play button, but ran out of time.

Run main.java to play the game.
